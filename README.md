## 1. Introduction
Click-Through Rate (CTR) is a crucial metric in online advertising. It measures the effectiveness of an advertisement by calculating the ratio of users who click on the ad to the number of total users who viewed the ad. Analyzing CTR data and predicting future CTR can help advertisers make informed decisions and optimize their ad campaigns.

This repository provides a step-by-step guide on how to analyze CTR data and build a predictive model for CTR using Python and various machine learning techniques.

## 2. Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided notebooks)
- Required Python libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn)

## 3. Dataset
For this project, we will use a sample CTR dataset. You can find the dataset in the `data` folder. The dataset contains the following columns:
- `impressions`: Number of times the ad was shown.
- `clicks`: Number of times users clicked on the ad.
- `date`: Date of the data entry.
- `ad_id`: Unique identifier for the ad.
- `campaign_id`: Unique identifie

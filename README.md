## 1. Introduction
Click-Through Rate (CTR) is a crucial metric in online advertising. It measures the effectiveness of an advertisement by calculating the ratio of users who click on the ad to the number of total users who viewed the ad. Analyzing CTR data and predicting future CTR can help advertisers make informed decisions and optimize their ad campaigns.

This repository provides a step-by-step guide on how to analyze CTR data and build a predictive model for CTR using Python and various machine learning techniques.

## 2. Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided notebooks)
- Required Python libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn)

## 3. Dataset
For this project, we will use a sample CTR dataset. You can find the dataset in the `data` folder. The dataset contains the following columns:
- `impressions`: Number of times the ad was shown.
- `clicks`: Number of times users clicked on the ad.
- `date`: Date of the data entry.
- `ad_id`: Unique identifier for the ad.
- `campaign_id`: Unique identifier for the campaign.

## 4. Analysis
### Data Preprocessing
- Load and inspect the dataset.
- Handle missing values if any.
- Convert data types as needed.
- Handle outliers if necessary.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize the distribution of CTR.
- Explore trends over time.
- Analyze the relationship between different features and CTR.

## 5. CTR Prediction
### Feature Engineering
- Create relevant features from the dataset.
- Encode categorical variables.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.

### Model Selection
- Choose suitable machine learning models for CTR prediction.
- Train multiple models and evaluate their performance.

### Training and Evaluation
- Train the selected model(s) on the training data.
- Evaluate the model(s) using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., ROC-AUC, F1-score, etc.).
- Fine-tune hyperparameters if necessary.
- Make predictions on the test data and assess the model's performance.

## 6. Conclusion
Summarize the findings from the analysis and the performance of the CTR prediction model(s). Provide insights and recommendations for improving ad campaigns based on the analysis.

## 7. References
List any external resources, libraries, or articles used during the project.
